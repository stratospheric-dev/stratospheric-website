      If you are Spring Boot developer and looking to explore how to deploy your applications onto AWS, then you need to check out this book.
      The authors have put together a well thought out and easy to follow book that walks you through the typical use cases you will need.
      Perfect for beginners and an invaluable reference guide for those more experienced, they continue to add new content to this book and I cannot say enough great things about it.

      One of the most-frequent questions I get from developers is how they can get started with AWS without having to first learn and understand all the details of the hundreds of available services.
      In their book, Tom, Philip, and BjÃ¶rn do an excellent job, initially focusing on just a few basic services to quickly get you started.
      Once your application is up and running, you gradually add additional capabilities, like continuous integration, monitoring, alerting, and automated incident response.
      If you are a Java developer wanting to learn how to build and run your applications in the cloud, Stratospheric is exactly what you need.

      This is an excellent book for every Spring Boot developer who wants to level up their
      knowledge and move their applications to the AWS cloud. I'm still halfway through the book,
      and it feels like someone is taking me by my hand into the AWS forest of services. The
      writers went just deep enough (and not too much) into each service they tackled and included
      practical exercises to follow along the way. That's giving confidence and instilling the
      learning naturally.

      I found the explanations lucid and succinct with excellent worked examples.
