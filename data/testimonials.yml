      If you are Spring Boot developer and looking to explore how to deploy your applications onto AWS, then you need to check out this book.
      <br/><br/>
      The authors have put together a well thought out and easy to follow book that walks you through the typical use cases you will need.
      <br/><br/>
      Perfect for beginners and an invaluable reference guide for those more experienced, they continue to add new content to this book and I cannot say enough great things about it.

      This is an excellent book for every Spring Boot developer who wants to level up their
      knowledge and move their applications to the AWS cloud. I'm still halfway through the book,
      and it feels like someone is taking me by my hand into the AWS forest of services.
      <br/><br/>
      The writers went just deep enough (and not too much) into each service they tackled and included
      practical exercises to follow along the way. That's giving confidence and instilling the
      learning naturally.

      One of the most-frequent questions I get from developers is how they can get started with AWS without having to first learn and understand all the details of the hundreds of available services.
      <br/><br/>
      In their book, Tom, Philip, and Björn do an excellent job, initially focusing on just a few basic services to quickly get you started.
      <br/><br/>
      Once your application is up and running, you gradually add additional capabilities, like continuous integration, monitoring, alerting, and automated incident response.
      <br/><br/>
      If you are a Java developer wanting to learn how to build and run your applications in the cloud, Stratospheric is exactly what you need.

      Björn, Philip, and Tom do a great job on teaching how to build a Java application on AWS.
      <br/><br/>
      I highly recommend the book to Java developers. The book uses modern AWS services, that are ready for production workloads, and avoids the bleeding edge. The examples show how to bundle your app into a container image and deploy it with ECS and Fargate, which is my preferred architecture.
      <br/><br/>
      I highly appreciate, that the book even covers monitoring and creating a deployment pipeline.

      I found the explanations lucid and succinct with excellent worked examples.
      <br/><br/>
      I would highly recommend this book - it's great value and I look forward to the online course also.
