            <p>This is an excellent book for every Spring Boot developer who wants to level up their
              knowledge and move their applications to the AWS cloud. I'm still halfway through the book,
              and it feels like someone is taking me by my hand into the AWS forest of services. The
              writers went just deep enough (and not too much) into each service they tackled and included
              practical exercises to follow along the way. That's giving confidence and instilling the
              learning naturally.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="panel"><p>
              Absolutely. <br/><br/>
              That was the main idea behind the book and the perspective from which we wrote it.
            </p></div>

              Do you offer discounts for students?
            </button>
            <div class="panel"><p>
              No, it doesn't. <br/><br/>
              You probably couldn't write a book covering all of those. Instead, we decided to use and
              write about the most commonly useful services and use cases for generic web applications,
              such as SQL databases with RDS, key-value stores with DynamoDB, messaging with SQS and
              ActiveMQ, Cognito for registration and login, and SES for sending emails.<br><br/>
              The general integration workflow is similar for other services, though, and the AWS Java SDK
              makes it convenient to use other services, too.
            </p></div>
            <button class="accordion">

            <div class="panel"><p>
              A lot of what we covered in the book is applicable to EKS / Kubernetes.<br/><br/>
              Everything except the Service CDK stack is independent of ECS. Besides, Docker can be used
              with EKS, too.

              Yes, we do.<br/><br/>
              We're going to publish an online course, which will take segments from the book and present
              those in bite-sized pieces one can easily follow along.<br><br/>
              We'll also continue to publish additional relevant content on our blogs (<a

              <a href="https://bjoernkw.com">bjoernkw.com</a>). So make sure to check those out every now
              and then, too.

                Writing the book together worked very well.<br/><br/>
                As somewhat stereotypical software engineers, we like to mostly work by ourselves but
                also want to collaborate and regularly exchange ideas and feedback on our work.<br><br/>
                We approached writing the book like a software development project:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>We had two-week sprints.</li>
                <li>We met every two weeks on Zoom.</li>
                <li>The process organically evolved into an agile process.</li>
                <li>We had a review process with pull requests for each finished chapter.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We also split up the other tasks associated with writing and publishing a book (e.g.,
                marketing) among the three of us.<br><br/>
                Self-publishing has been a real boon to us. There was no outside pressure but we had the
                intrinsic motivation to quickly and regularly provide value to our readers.

              Does the online course cover all topics of the book?

              Probably too many to mention them all :-) <br/><br/>
              We expanded our own knowledge regarding developing software with and deploying applications
              on AWS. There are some pitfalls when working with AWS services in general and the CDK
              specifically, but overall, the self-service and infrastructure-as-code approach those enable
              are a huge step forward.<br><br/>
              Collaboratively writing and self-publishing an eBook has been a tremendous experience, too.
              We learned a lot about writing, marketing, and polishing over the course of this process.

              Where applicable (e.g., with Amazon RDS or Amazon MQ), we used the smallest possible
              instance types, because for demonstration purposes those were sufficient.<br><br/>
              More generally, we set a monthly budget within the AWS Billing Console alongside an alert
              that notified use once a specific budget threshold had been reached.

              We supply environment and application names for the chapter-specific versions of our sample
              Todo application, for example. <br/><br/>
              Where applicable and necessary, we use those to define namespaces. This allows to keep
              multiple versions of the application separate from each other and manage resources belonging
              to a specific version.

              No, we haven't. <br/><br/>

              AWS not only is the largest and most widely used cloud provider, it also was the one we were
              most familiar with from client work and previous projects.<br/><br/>
              It only seemed natural to write about something we had already been using to some extent at
              least and for which we knew there was sizeable demand.<br><br/>
              With Java being one of the major deployment targets for AWS and Spring/Spring Boot being
              well-supported through Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud AWS and the AWS Java SDK, ease-of-use and
              robust, reliable tooling probably are the major benefits of using Spring Boot in conjunction
              with AWS.

              When embarking on this project, we quickly arrived at $39 as an appropriate price point for
              what we envisioned, i.e., a comprehensive, from-start-to-finish guide for developing and
              deploying a Spring Boot application with AWS and the value such a book can provide to the
              reader.<br><br/>
              With the initial release and the first few chapters in November 2020, we set the price to
              $20 and gradually increased the price from there with each subsequent release that contained
              additional content.<br/><br/>
              This approach - not unlike crowdfunding but with the added benefit of immediate value
              provided - allowed readers to support as early on, while it motivated us to publish at
              regular intervals and at a rapid pace to show we deserve that trust.
