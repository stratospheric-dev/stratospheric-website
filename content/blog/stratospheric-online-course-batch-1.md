Last week we have closed batch #0 of the Stratospheric online course early bird program! Previously, the online course has been just a "shell" with a single sample video. With the new release, the course now contains 10 videos about the following topics:

**Part I: Deploying with AWS**

- Deployment Options with AWS
- Getting Ready to Use AWS
- Deploy a Docker Image to Amazon ECR

**Part II: Spring Boot & AWS**

- What We're Going to Build: A Sample Todo Application
- Local Development
- Connecting to a Database with Amazon RDS (Parts I and II)

**Part III: Production Readiness with AWS**

- Getting Started with Amazon CloudWatch
- Downsides of Logging Unstructured Text
- Logging Structured Text with Logback and Amazon CloudWatch

We are continuously working to add more content. **We're planning with a total of about 45 videos in the final release** that will go well together with the book.

If you have already bought the course, please check out the videos. Let us know about any feedback you might have. Can we improve somehow? Do the videos leave questions open?

We're happy to chat!
