This online course will teach you **how to develop a production-ready Spring Boot application and deploy it to AWS** while integrating several AWS services:

*Infrastructure as code*: Learn how to use the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to define the entire infrastructure with Java code.

*Integrate AWS services*: Get familiar with powerful AWS services by implementing features for the sample application.

*Deployment*: Automate the CI/CD pipeline to get changes deployed to production in a matter of minutes using GitHub Actions.

*Operations*: Effectively monitor and operate a Spring Boot application in production.

## Assess your skills and get certified
Test and assess your knowledge after each major section with a quiz.

You'll receive a *certificate* after passing all quizzes.

While the official AWS certifications focus only on the cloud provider and its services, the *Stratospheric online course* additionally covers those specific aspects you need to know about as an application developer, too.

## Remote & on-demand learning experience
Work through the lessons at your own pace wherever you are and whenever you like.

Join an *active community* of fellow cloud enthusiasts.

With the Stratospheric online course, you join a vibrant community of fellow AWS and Spring Boot enthusiasts.
