We're happy to announce the next three course lessons of the Stratospheric online course. With this release, we'll close our early-bird batch #3 and start our last batch.

We pushed our completeness bar on Leanpub to 70% and are now looking forward to finishing the course in the upcoming months.

The new videos at a glance:

**Part I: Deploying with AWS**

- Deploying a Network Stack with CDK
- Deploying a Service Stack with CDK

**Part II: Spring Boot & AWS**

- Sharing Todos with Amazon SQS and Amazon SES

**Part III: Production Readiness with AWS**

No new video within this batch.

**We're planning with a total of about 45 videos in the final release** that will go well together with the book.

If you have already bought the course, please check out the new videos. Let us know about any feedback you might have. Can we improve somehow? Do the videos leave questions open?
