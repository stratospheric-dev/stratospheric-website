It's time for a new Stratospheric eBook release ðŸ¥³

With our current [Stratospheric online course](https://stratospheric.dev/online-course/) recording efforts, we added a ready-to-use blueprint for an operational Amazon CloudWatch Dashboard for our Spring Boot application:

{{< responsiveimage "/images/releases/cloud-watch-dashboard.png" "Stratospheric Operational Amazon CloudWatch Dashboard" >}}

While we explain the basic building blocks on how to create an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard with the AWS CDK, we never had a ready-to-use dashboard with key metrics for the Todo application.

The [`OperationalCloudWatchDasbord`](https://github.com/stratospheric-dev/stratospheric/blob/main/cdk/src/main/java/dev/stratospheric/todoapp/cdk/OperationalCloudWatchDashboard.java) fills this gap and visualizes the following information:

- the recent info and error logs from our Spring Boot application
- the distribution (count) of the different log levels
- CPU utilization and JVM memory consumption of the Spring Boot application
- important ELB metrics: the distribution of returned status codes and the average response times
- key RDS metrics for the CPU usage, storage, and open JDBC connections
- metrics for the SQS queue and its dead-letter queue to identify failed or slow message consumptions

This dashboard is created with the AWS CDK and can be used as a source of inspiration for your first Amazon CloudWatch dashboard.

Furthermore, we fixed some inconsistencies in our manuscript. Thanks to Alan ([amoffet](https://github.com/amoffet)) for [reporting them](https://github.com/stratospheric-dev/stratospheric/issues/140).

With our goal to keep the content relevant and up-to-date, we sometimes fail to keep the manuscript in sync or miss sections to adjust. Feel free [to report](https://github.com/stratospheric-dev/stratospheric/issues/new/choose) any inconsistencies as soon as you find them.

Finally, as our [complementary online course](https://stratospheric.dev/online-course/) is making good progress, we now refer to it as part of the introduction and outro.
