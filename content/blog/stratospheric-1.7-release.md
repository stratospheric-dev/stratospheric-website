It's time for a new Stratospheric eBook release ðŸ¥³

Things:

In short, with the revision v1.7 of Stratospheric, we changed the following:

- M1 support for local development (for more head over [here](https://rieckpil.de/java-development-on-an-apple-m1-a-one-year-review/))
- Alignment of properties over profile (rationale [here](https://reflectoring.io/dont-use-spring-profile-annotation/))
- Refactoring, a bit sloppy. Focus lies on the integration part
- Not yet in the book, testing part, sneak peek in inside `src/test/resource`

Thanks again for supporting us and our work. Remember, every [mailing list subscriber](/#mailing-list) gets 30% off the final price of the eBook.
