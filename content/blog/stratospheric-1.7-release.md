It's time for a new Stratospheric eBook release ðŸ¥³

We took a [bug](https://github.com/stratospheric-dev/stratospheric/issues/117) as an initiative to invest some time into refactoring and adding a covering test suite. We've added an integration test to cover the CRUD operations for our `Todo` entity and a basic web test to interact with the OAuth2 login and ensure the basic pages render properly.

There's no dedicated section in the book about testing yet. For the curious, you can have a sneak peek at the `src/test/resources` folder of our application [on GitHub](https://github.com/stratospheric-dev/stratospheric/tree/main/application/src/test).

After finishing our current [online course efforts](https://stratospheric.dev/online-course/), we'll get back to the testing topic and dedicate a chapter in the book about testing. In the meantime, check out the various testing articles on [Philip's blog](https://rieckpil.de/all-posts/).

Furthermore, with the revision v1.7 of Stratospheric, we changed the following:

- We added Apple M1 processor (ARM63) support for local development by upgrading to the latest Keycloak and LocalStack Docker image
- We favored custom properties over Spring profiles for loading beans and configuring the application (rationale [here](https://reflectoring.io/dont-use-spring-profile-annotation/))
- Basic refactoring efforts for the `TodoService` and `TodoController`. The previous implementation was a bit sloppy.

Thanks again for supporting us and our work. Remember, every [mailing list subscriber](/#mailing-list) gets 30% off the final price of the eBook.
