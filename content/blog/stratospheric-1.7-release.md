It's time for a new Stratospheric eBook release ðŸ¥³

With [this bug](https://github.com/stratospheric-dev/stratospheric/issues/117) as additional motivation, we took the opportunity to invest some time into refactoring and adding a test suite to our sample Todo app for improving code coverage: We've added both an integration test to cover the CRUD operations for our `Todo` entity and a basic web test for verifying interaction with the OAuth 2 login and for ensuring the crucial pages of our app render properly.

Although there's no dedicated section in the book about testing (yet), if you're curious, you can have a sneak peek at the `src/test/resources` folder of our application [at GitHub](https://github.com/stratospheric-dev/stratospheric/tree/main/application/src/test).

Once we'll have finished our current [online course efforts](https://stratospheric.dev/online-course/), we'll get back to the subject of testing and dedicate an entire chapter about testing to the book! In the meantime, check out the various articles about testing on [Philip's blog](https://rieckpil.de/all-posts/).

Furthermore, with the revision v1.7 of Stratospheric, we changed the following:

- We added Apple M1 processor (ARM64) support for local development by upgrading to the latest Keycloak and LocalStack Docker images, respectively.
- We favored custom properties over Spring profiles for loading beans and configuring the application (see [this article](https://reflectoring.io/dont-use-spring-profile-annotation/) for the rationale behind this).
- Basic refactoring efforts for the `TodoService` and `TodoController`. The previous implementation admittedly was a bit sloppy.

Thanks again for supporting us and our work. Remember, every [mailing list subscriber](/#mailing-list) gets 30% off the final price of the eBook.
