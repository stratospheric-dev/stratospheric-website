Stratospheric not only speaks English, [habla espa√±ol tambien](https://leanpub.com/stratospheric-es), [und nun auch Deutsch](https://leanpub.com/stratospheric-de)!

We're happy to announce that in addition to the original English version (and [the Spanish edition](https://leanpub.com/stratospheric-es) Stratospheric now is available as a [German edition](https://leanpub.com/stratospheric-de), too.

So, if you prefer to read about getting started with Spring Boot and AWS in your own native language and that native language happens to be German (or Spanish, respectively) go and check it out: https://leanpub.com/stratospheric-de
