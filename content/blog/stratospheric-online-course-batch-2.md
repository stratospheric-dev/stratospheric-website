Yesterday, we have closed batch #1 of the Stratospheric online course! We have added 7 new videos for a total of 17 videos now.

The new videos at a glance:

**Part I: Deploying with AWS**

- Getting Started with CloudFormation
- Deploying a Network Stack with CloudFormation
- Deploying a Service Stack with CloudFormation

**Part III: Production Readiness with AWS**

- Analyzing Structured Logs with Amazon CloudWatch
- Monitoring Metrics with Amazon CloudWatch
- Sending Default Spring Boot Metrics to Amazon CloudWatch
- Sending Custom Micrometer Metrics to Amazon CloudWatch

**We're planning with a total of about 45 videos in the final release** that will go well together with the book.
