We're happy to announce that the Stratospheric sample Todo application and the CDK infrastructure project now support Java 17.

Java 17 was released in September 2021 and is the next LTS (Long Term Support) release after Java 11.

[Many Java language improvements](https://dzone.com/articles/whats-new-between-java-11-and-java-17) were released between Java 11 and 17 and it's definitely worth migrating to Java 17 as soon as possible.

In short, with the revision v1.5 of Stratospheric, we changed the following:

- Changed the Java version for the Gradle project (sample application) and the Maven project (CDK) to Java 17.
- Adjusted the GitHub Actions to use JDK 17.
- Updated the Dockerfile to use a JDK 17 base image.
