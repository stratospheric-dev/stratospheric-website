We're happy to announce the next eight course lessons of the Stratospheric online course. With this release, we'll close our early batch #2 and start the second last batch.

We pushed our completeness bar on Leanpub to 60% and are now looking forward to finishing the course in the upcoming months.

**Part I: Deploying with AWS**

- Getting Started with CDK

**Part II: Spring Boot & AWS**

- Building User Registration and Login with Amazon Cognito Part I

**Part III: Production Readiness with AWS**

**We're planning with a total of about 45 videos in the final release** that will go well together with the book.
