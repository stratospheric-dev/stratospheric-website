            Is there a Discord, mailing list, or a hash tag for working through the book in groups?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            So far, there hasn't been. <br/> <br/>
            This is a great idea, though, which is why decided to create a Slack community for
            Stratospheric, where you can discuss the book, ask questions, and work through the book
            together.<br> <br/>
            If you'd like to join the Slack community, please <a href="mailto:info@stratospheric.dev">drop
            us a note</a>.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            Why was the decision made to use CDK instead of Terraform, Sceptre etc.?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            Ultimately, because the three of us know Java very well. We wanted to express the deployment
            workflow in language we were already familiar with.<br><br>
            Furthermore, the book is about Spring Boot. Hence, it's only natural to use the same
            language and ecosystem, so as the reader you don't have to switch contexts.<br><br>
            Originally, we were going to use CloudFormation and the JSON or YAML configuration files
            that come with that. However, that approach turned out to be not particularly readable and
            maintainable.<br><br>
            AWS CDK has gained quite some traction and is starting to get more mature. Apart from Java,
            CDK is available for TypeScript and Python, too.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            Will this book be a great addition for people with Spring Boot but little to no AWS
            knowledge?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            Absolutely. <br/><br/>
            That was the main idea behind the book and the perspective from which we wrote it.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            Does the book target all AWS services that work or integrate with Spring Boot?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            No, it doesn't. <br/><br/>
            You probably couldn't write a book covering all of those. Instead, we decided to use and
            write about the most commonly useful services and use cases for generic web applications,
            such as SQL databases with RDS, key-value stores with DynamoDB, messaging with SQS and
            ActiveMQ, Cognito for registration and login, and SES for sending emails.<br><br/>
            The general integration workflow is similar for other services, though, and the AWS Java SDK
            makes it convenient to use other services, too.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            Is the content of this book be applicable to a Kubernetes-based runtime?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            A lot of what we covered in the book is applicable to EKS / Kubernetes.<br/><br/>
            Everything except the Service CDK stack is independent of ECS. Besides, Docker can be used
            with EKS, too.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            Do you have any plans for further books/content around Spring/AWS?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            Yes, we do.<br/><br/>
            We're going to publish an online course, which will take segments from the book and present
            those in bite-sized pieces one can easily follow along.<br><br/>
            We'll also continue to publish additional relevant content on our blogs (<a
            href="https://reflectoring.io">reflectoring.io</a>, <a href="https://rieckpil.de/">rieckpil.de</a>,

            What was the experience as a co-author like?
          </button>
          <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Writing the book together worked very well.<br/><br/>
              As somewhat stereotypical software engineers, we like to mostly work by ourselves but
              also want to collaborate and regularly exchange ideas and feedback on our work.<br><br/>
              We approached writing the book like a software development project:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We had two-week sprints.</li>
              <li>We met every two weeks on Zoom.</li>
              <li>The process organically evolved into an agile process.</li>
              <li>We had a review process with pull requests for each finished chapter.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We also split up the other tasks associated with writing and publishing a book (e.g.,
              marketing) among the three of us.<br><br/>
              Self-publishing has been a real boon to us. There was no outside pressure but we had the
              intrinsic motivation to quickly and regularly provide value to our readers.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="accordion">
            What are your learnings from writing this book?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            Probably too many to mention them all :-) <br/><br/>
            We expanded our own knowledge regarding developing software with and deploying applications
            on AWS. There are some pitfalls when working with AWS services in general and the CDK
            specifically, but overall, the self-service and infrastructure-as-code approach those enable
            are a huge step forward.<br><br/>
            Collaboratively writing and self-publishing an eBook has been a tremendous experience, too.
            We learned a lot about writing, marketing, and polishing over the course of this process.
          </p></div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 services-title-section">
        <div class="services-accordion">
          <button class="accordion">
            How much does the AWS infrastructure we're building as part of the book cost per month?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            The AWS infrastructure spun up during the course of the book costs about 100 to 110 euros
            per month, depending on what you do and how often you deploy or recreate certain resources
            (e.g., the ActiveMQ WebSocket relay).<br><br/>
            This might be a little too much for a pet project but seems alright for a small startup.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            Can an AWS setup be configured to shut everything down if the bill reaches X dollars?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            Unfortunately, not that we know of. <br/><br/>
            You can merely create alerts within the AWS Billing Console, which will ping you once a
            specified threshold has been reached. Those are just notifications, though. There's no
            simple service or feature that allows you to shut down resources automatically once costs
            exceed a certain level.<br><br/>
            A possible approach to try out, though, might be an event triggering a Lambda function for
            executing CDK commands, which then destroy the infrastructure.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            How did you reduce AWS costs and avoid surprise bills?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            Where applicable (e.g., with Amazon RDS or Amazon MQ), we used the smallest possible
            instance types, because for demonstration purposes those were sufficient.<br><br/>
            More generally, we set a monthly budget within the AWS Billing Console alongside an alert
            that notified use once a specific budget threshold had been reached.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            How do you manage multiple versions when deploying Spring Boot applications?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            We supply environment and application names for the chapter-specific versions of our sample
            Todo application, for example. <br/><br/>
            Where applicable and necessary, we use those to define namespaces. This allows to keep
            multiple versions of the application separate from each other and manage resources belonging
            to a specific version.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            Have you worked with using social logins for logging into the Stratospheric Todo
            application?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            No, we haven't. <br/><br/>
            However, you can easily implement social logins with Amazon Cognito.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            What made you pick AWS over other cloud vendors?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            AWS not only is the largest and most widely used cloud provider, it also was the one we were
            most familiar with from client work and previous projects.<br/><br/>
            It only seemed natural to write about something we had already been using to some extent at
            least and for which we knew there was sizeable demand.<br><br/>
            With Java being one of the major deployment targets for AWS and Spring/Spring Boot being
            well-supported through Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud AWS and the AWS Java SDK, ease-of-use and
            robust, reliable tooling probably are the major benefits of using Spring Boot in conjunction
            with AWS.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            How did you write the book?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            The book has been written entirely in <a href="http://markua.com/"
                                                     target="_blank">Markua</a> - Leanpub's Markdown
            flavor. <br/><br/>
            The book's layout is generated through <a href="https://leanpub.com/" target="_blank">Leanpub</a>.
            For our writing process we made use of feature branches and pull requests reviews on GitHub.
          </p></div>
          <button class="accordion">
            How did you set the price for the book?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            When embarking on this project, we quickly arrived at $39 as an appropriate price point for
            what we envisioned, i.e., a comprehensive, from-start-to-finish guide for developing and
            deploying a Spring Boot application with AWS and the value such a book can provide to the
            reader.<br><br/>
            With the initial release and the first few chapters in November 2020, we set the price to
            $20 and gradually increased the price from there with each subsequent release that contained
            additional content.<br/><br/>
            This approach - not unlike crowdfunding but with the added benefit of immediate value
            provided - allowed readers to support as early on, while it motivated us to publish at
            regular intervals and at a rapid pace to show we deserve that trust.

          <div class="panel"><p>
            Yes, they do. <br/><br/>
            The combined use of AWS and Spring Boot is well-supported through Spring Cloud, Spring Cloud
            AWS and the AWS Java SDK.

            Yes, absolutely. <br/><br/>
            We'll continue to write the occasional newsletter and also send updates via Leanpub whenever
            there's a new version of Stratospheric available.

            How longs does it take to complete the eBook including the hands-on part?

          <div class="panel"><p>
            Honestly, we have no idea :-) <br/><br/>
            This mostly depends on a specific reader's pace. Clocking in at about 450 pages and roughly
            80,000 words, "Stratospheric - From Zero to Production with Spring Boot and AWS" isn't
            exactly a short book. You can certainly read the book from start to finish. We hope we've
            provided enough of a storyline and common thread for you to do so and follow along.<br><br/>
            However, to a large extent, we designed both the three main parts and the chapters
            themselves to be modular. This allows you to pick out those sections and subjects that are
            most relevant to you at any given time.

            First and foremost, our own work experience and previous client work has served as
            inspiration for working with this particular set of technologies. <br/><br/>
            From this previous experience knew there was significant demand but very little in the way
            of comprehensive guides or tutorials that not only help you with getting started with AWS
            and Spring Boot but really guide you all the way to a production-ready application and cloud
            deployment setup.

            Whether you're making decisions at your place of work or you're working in a larger team, we

          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            No, it isn't. <br/><br/>
            We probably could've written more tests but test coverage wasn't our primary focus while
            writing the book and the companion app.<br/><br/>
            If you'd like to delve more deeply into this subject you might want to take a look at the
            resources provided on <a href="https://rieckpil.de/">Philip's website</a> under "Testing
            Java Applications Made Simple".

            What's your experience with Leanpub?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            Working with Leanpub has been a terrific experience.<br/><br/>
            Both the self-publishing approach in general and the integration with tools such as GitHub
            lent themselves to our writing process and the way we wanted to manage and publish our
            content. The idea of self-publishing in particular was what convinced us to use a service
            such as Leanpub.

            Does the source code in the book use AWS Java SDK v1 or v2?
          </button>
          <div class="panel"><p>
            The source code depends on AWS Java SDK v1 since we're currently still using Spring Cloud
            AWS 2.2.x, which in turn transitively depends on AWS Java SDK 1.x.

            Will this eBook teach you how to deploy a Spring Boot Backend on AWS?

          <div class="panel"><p>
            Yes, it will. <br/><br/>
            The book describes in detail how to deploy the resources and the relevant infrastructure
            used with AWS CDK.

              For the user interface we used <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/" target="_blank">Thymeleaf</a>.
              Additionally, we used these libraries and frameworks:

            Is there a Kotlin version of CDK?

          <div class="panel"><p>
            As of today (August 8th, 2021), there isn't, unfortunately. <br/><br/>
            See <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/557">this GitHub issue</a> for possible
            future updates. According to the <a
            href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/work-with-cdk-java.html">CDK
            documentation</a> "it is possible to write AWS CDK applications in JVM-hosted languages
            other than Java". However, AWS doesn't provide any support for that.

            Yes, it is.<br/><br/>
            The chapters on "The Sample Todo Application", "Building User Registration and Login with

            specifically make us of Spring Cloud AWS.
